## challenges 

This is my very first project using Tailwind. The biggest challenge and the
most obvious one is my lack of familiarity with the framework, thus I had
to look up the documents a lot. Apart from that, it all came as second nature
as I'm familir with using CSS.

This is a Frontend Mentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io) and I built
it all by myself without following any tutorial or getting help from someone else.
